## Overview

As a solo creator with a proven AI-Native Product Ops Playbook (field-tested at Adidas), you have multiple avenues to monetise your expertise. This guide explores quick digital products, team licensing, interactive training, B2B services, pricing models, and marketing channels – emphasising fast vs medium-term pathways and highest return-on-effort. All recommendations use UK English and leverage your existing credibility.

## Digital Productisation Options

Monetising the playbook as a digital product can generate income with minimal overhead. Key formats include eBooks, templates, paid newsletters, and AI toolkits. These are quick to launch and scale with audience growth:

*   **Ebook or PDF Guide**: Convert the playbook into a polished eBook (PDF/Kindle). Platforms like Gumroad or Amazon Kindle allow easy listing with zero upfront cost. This one-time effort asset can sell repeatedly [1]. For instance, one consultant wrote a niche eBook during baby naptimes and earned ~$200/month in royalties [2] – modest but truly passive income. Price your guide based on value (e.g. £20–£50). Even without a large audience, a targeted eBook solving a pressing problem can trickle in sales and bolster your credibility.
*   **Notion Template or Toolkit**: Transform your playbook into an interactive Notion workspace or toolkit (complete with dashboards, templates, and AI prompts). Notion’s huge user base means templates can sell well if they save time. Some creators earn ~$1,000+ per month from a single template – one marketer’s $50 Notion template for writers nets $400–$500/mo on Notion’s marketplace plus roughly double that via her own site [3]. Top performers like Thomas Frank have even hit $1M/year selling Notion templates to a broad audience [4]. While your results may vary, a well-designed template that operationalises your playbook can be a fast win. You can sell through Notion’s Marketplace or via Gumroad. Use your Adidas case study to stand out (e.g. “Template based on system used at Adidas”).
*   **Substack or Paid Newsletter**: If writing regular insights appeals to you, consider a Substack newsletter to build an audience and offer premium content. Newsletters take longer to monetise, but can become stable recurring income. Substack math: 1,000 subscribers at $5/month yields ~$60k/year [5]. While reaching 1k paid subs is medium-term, you could start free posts now (leveraging LinkedIn to drive sign-ups) and introduce a paid tier containing exclusive playbook deep-dives, case studies, or a “monthly AI Ops tip sheet”. Realistically, many newsletter writers take months to grow and many earn modestly [6] [7] – but a niche, high-value newsletter (e.g. AI Product Ops Insights) can command loyalty.
*   **“AI Agent” Packs or Prompt Libraries**: Package your best AI prompts, workflows, or even a custom AI chatbot trained on the playbook. Product managers might pay for an “AI Ops co-pilot” that you’ve curated. For example, you might create a collection of ChatGPT prompts or a small AI agent (via tools like GPT-4 or no-code) to automate product ops tasks (roadmapping, analysis, etc.). These could be sold as a digital download or monthly subscription. While a niche idea, it aligns with the AI-powered workflow theme. If executed well, it differentiates you and could be upsold alongside the eBook (“Get the playbook + AI toolkit bundle”). Pricing can be value-based – if it saves hours of work, £49–£199 for an agent pack is reasonable.

> **Tip**: Digital products shine long-term: once created, they sell infinitely without extra effort per sale [8] [9]. However, expect a ramp-up period. Content businesses “take months to generate meaningful income but can eventually earn while you sleep” [10]. To get quick traction, leverage free marketing: announce your eBook/template on LinkedIn, ask peers at Adidas to share a testimonial, offer an early-bird discount for first buyers (to get reviews), and maybe list on niche marketplaces (Notion Marketplace, Product Hunt, etc.). These steps cost £0 and utilise your network rather than paid ads.

## Licensing Models for Teams & Enterprises

Consider licensing your playbook to organisations for internal use. This involves selling usage rights of your IP (the content, frameworks, and templates) to a client for a fee or royalty. Licensing can be lucrative and relatively hands-off once a deal is struck:

*   **Enterprise/Team License**: Provide the playbook (and possibly associated materials or template kit) to a company for an annual or one-time license fee. For example, you could charge a corporation £5,000–£10,000 per year for unlimited internal use of the playbook PDF, or £500 per user in a team. Make it clear what they get – e.g. a branded version of the playbook, permission to distribute to all team members, and perhaps a live kickoff session. Successful course creators have generated passive income by licensing training content to companies [11]. It’s a win-win: the company saves time developing their own AI Ops training, and you earn royalties or flat fees for content you’ve already created [12].
*   **Multi-Team or Departmental Licenses**: If an organisation has, say, 5 product teams, offer tiered pricing – e.g. £2k for one team, £6k for enterprise-wide access. You retain ownership and can license the same content to multiple clients (non-exclusively), compounding your revenue. Emphasise that licensing your tried-and-tested playbook mitigates their risk and gives them a ready-made program “as used at Adidas”. The credibility of a global brand having used your playbook is a powerful trust signal. (Ensure you have permission to mention Adidas; if so, a short case study included in the materials can sweeten the deal.)
*   **Customisation & Certification**: As an added upsell, you might offer to tailor the playbook to the client’s context or co-brand it. Another model is a “train-the-trainer” license – e.g. for an extra fee, allow the client’s internal coaches to run workshops using your content (possibly certifying them as facilitators of your methodology). This can command premium pricing and spreads your framework within organisations without you having to be present every time.

> **Example**: A leadership trainer might license her course to multiple Fortune 500s, each paying a flat fee to use it in-house – turning her one-off effort into recurring revenue. In your domain, imagine a consultancy or a SaaS firm wanting to instil AI-native operations in all product teams: instead of reinventing the wheel, they pay you for your proven playbook. LearnWorlds notes that licensing existing training content can expand your reach and create passive income while reinforcing your authority as an expert [13] [14]. It’s also highly scalable: two corporate licenses at £10k each would out-earn many individual ebook sales.

> **Practical Steps**: Approach organisations where you have an “in.” Adidas might be interested in a broader license beyond the initial team, or could refer you to partners/clients. Also target similar companies (sportswear, FMCG, tech) by reaching out to innovation or L&D heads on LinkedIn. Highlight the strategic value – e.g. “Accelerate your product operations with an AI playbook developed at Adidas.” Be prepared to provide a snippet or demo under NDA. Also, draft a simple content licensing agreement covering scope (who can use it, for how long), fees, and that you retain IP ownership [15] [16]. Licensing deals can take a few months to close (corporate procurement can be slow), but each success yields a high payout for relatively low incremental work.

## Workshops and Cohort-Based Monetisation

Turning your playbook into an interactive learning experience – whether a one-off workshop or a multi-week cohort course – can rapidly monetise your expertise at a higher price point per customer. People pay for access to you and the promise of outcomes, not just the content. Here are options:

*   **Live Workshops (Virtual or In-Person)**: You can offer a half-day or full-day workshop where you teach principles from the playbook and guide participants through exercises. Platforms like Butter (virtual workshop facilitator) or Zoom (with breakouts) work well, or in-person for local companies. Charge per seat (e.g. £100–£300 per person for a half-day live online workshop, more if in-person or including consulting). If you get 20 attendees at £150 each, that’s £3,000 in a day – a strong return on effort. Workshops can also be corporate-sponsored: for example, offer a tailored session to a company’s product team for a flat £2,000 + travel. These are quick to set up (you likely have slide material from Adidas) and can even act as lead generators for your consulting or course. Market a public workshop via LinkedIn posts and direct invitations (perhaps “AI Product Ops Bootcamp – 1 day intensive”). Platform tools (Butter, etc.) can handle tickets and make sessions engaging.
*   **Cohort-Based Courses**: This is a structured, multi-week program (e.g. 4–6 weeks, with weekly live classes and assignments) for a cohort of professionals. Platforms like Maven (a cohort-based course platform), Teachable or Maven’s Course Accelerator can help launch. Cohort courses are premium offerings – it’s not uncommon to charge £500–£2,000 per student for a several-week course that promises a career-enhancing outcome. Many independent experts have gone this route with great success: Maven reports instructors average ~$20,000 in revenue on their first cohort launch [17], and some earn six-figures a year from a course while still working full-time [18]. For example, Christian Wattig turned his professional expertise into a live FP&A bootcamp and now makes ~$100k/year on the side [19] – and this is in a niche topic. With AI Product Ops being timely, a cohort course titled “AI-Native Product Ops Masterclass” could attract product managers, ops leads, and consultants looking to upskill. If you price it at, say, £800 per seat for a 5-week program and enroll 15 people, that’s £12,000 in one cohort. Beyond revenue, you also deepen your reputation (cohort alumni become evangelists) and can reuse recorded materials later for an on-demand course.
*   **Cohort Platforms & Examples**: Maven is a popular choice – it handles enrollment, payments, and has a network effect (people go there to find courses). They also mentor new instructors. Other options include Maven, Eduflow, or even a private Slack + Zoom combo if you prefer DIY. The benefit of platforms like Maven is they’ve showcased successes: in their first months, several Maven courses earned over $100k [20], and instructors keep ~90% of revenue [21]. There are UK-based platforms too (e.g. *Maven’s cofounder is ex-UK, and platforms like Heights Platform or Teachable support GBP pricing). You can also consider Maven-like cohort via LinkedIn (LinkedIn Events + a closed community group for participants) to leverage your network. A real-world example: a marketing expert ran a “Write Sales Pages That Convert” cohort masterclass, charging $1,000+ per seat, and because participants saw 2-3x conversion lifts from the training, the price was easily justified [22]. Aim to deliver similarly tangible outcomes (e.g. each participant will implement an AI improvement to their workflow by end of course).
*   **Group Coaching or Mastermind**: A variant of cohort courses is a smaller group coaching (say 5-10 people) over a period, focusing on personalised guidance. This could be framed as a “Cohort Implementation Sprint” where you take a small group of product leaders through implementing the playbook in their own context, with weekly meetups to troubleshoot and share progress. This could be even pricier per person (more bespoke attention, perhaps £1,000+ each for a month-long sprint). It’s lower scale, but high impact and you can advertise the limited spots to create urgency.

> **Pros & Cons**: Live cohorts/workshops have high upfront effort – you must prepare curriculum, coordinate scheduling, and actively teach/coach (which can be intensive). However, the revenue per customer is high and you get funds in hand quickly (often students pay before the course). They also build community: you might spin off a Slack of alumni that later becomes a paid membership. The experience of running a course can further productise your knowledge (recordings can turn into a self-paced course or clips for marketing). Keep cohorts moderately sized to ensure quality, especially early on – stellar results and testimonials from the first cohort will help you fill the next one.

> **Action step**: Outline a 4-week syllabus based on your playbook (week 1: Strategy & Mindset, week 2: Human-AI collaboration tactics, etc.), decide on a platform (Maven’s free 3-week accelerator could be useful), and float the idea on LinkedIn to gauge interest (“Interested in a live course on AI Product Ops? Join the waitlist”). If you get interest, this could be a medium-term big win in monetisation.

## B2B Services & Consulting Packages

Given your background as a consultant, productised B2B services can be the fastest path to significant income. Instead of traditional open-ended consulting, productise your service offerings – define fixed-scope, high-value packages that apply the playbook to a client’s business. This yields clarity for clients and is easier to sell repeatedly. Some ideas:

*   **AI Ops Implementation Sprint**: Offer a time-boxed consulting engagement, e.g. “AI-Native Product Ops Sprint – 2 Week Implementation”. In this sprint, you could work with a client’s team to assess their current processes, implement key AI workflow improvements from the playbook, and deliver a roadmap or toolkit by the end. Because this has a defined timeline and outcome, it can be priced as a package (not per day), and potentially at a premium. For instance, a 2-week sprint that saves a team hundreds of hours might be priced at £8,000 – £15,000 depending on scope. Emphasise speed and tangible results (“in 10 days your product ops will be AI-augmented and your team trained in the new workflow”). This productised consulting approach “packages your time into an off-the-shelf product” and can greatly improve business stability with recurring or predictable bookings [23]. It also serves as a low-risk entry for new clients, who might then extend into a longer engagement.
